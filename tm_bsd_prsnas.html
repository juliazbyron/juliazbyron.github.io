		<h2>Team-Based Personas</h2>
		<h3>"Who does what? Where does the hand-off happen?"</h3>
		<h3>Opportunity</h3>
			<p>Although user personas capture the individual’s experience, they don’t show how different roles collaborate. Our project teams were creating generic, shallow, assumption-based personas that were being discarded early into the design process. This was causing major misunderstanding of the problems they were trying to solve and ineffective product development. We rethought personas to capture team dynamics while aligning everyone in product development.</p>
		<h3>Impact</h3>
			<p>Effected team alignment and direction, user and domain understanding and user empathy on our project team. 
			Facilitated deeper user research by providing foundational research up front.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>Team-based personas are a representation of a type of team we interviewed. They include the organization-influenced needs, concerns and goals that each team member shares. They also include the roles that participate in mobile app creation and the journey map of their tasks.</p>
		<h3>Process</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Product team survey</li>
				<li>User interviews</li>
				<li>Project team workshop</li>
				<li>Final outputs</li>
				<li>Scaling to my organization</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Team Survey</h3>
		<p>I sent an email survey out to my team of over 200 designers, product managers, developers, marketing and other roles.</p>
		<h4>I learned</h4>
		<p>“I want it customized for me” - I needed to address a wide range of users and topics while catering the info specifically to each team</p>
